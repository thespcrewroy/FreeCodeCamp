# Checkpoint ⛳️

Congratulations on completing the first four chapters of The Legend of Python! Now let's use the skills you've learned (variables, control flow statements, and loops) to build a Python project on your own.

Use the Python Code Editor, Visual Studio Code, or your code editor of choice for this project.

# Terminal Adventure Game

Create a terminal_game.py that walks the player through a captivating mini-game adventure! In each step of the adventure, the player should be presented with 2 or more options on where to go next.

Be as creative as you want with this, but make sure your code runs!

Some ideas include:

A space-based adventure of a crew of curious individuals exploring an unknown galaxy.
A “Day in the Life” story that walks you through choices the main character makes based on conditions like the time of day, the actions that the player take, etc.
A classic mini-RPG (role-playing game) with hp health points, character moves like attack/block/heal, and NPCs (non-player characters) that attacks based on a random number generator.

# Submit Your Project

After completing your project, join our Community and submit it to the Checkpoint channel. One of our team members will get back to you with feedback and the completion status!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the #python or #checkpoint Discord channels.

Happy coding!

# Goal

- You are an ancient space civilization that wants to manifest the power of the black hole
- There is a chest at the center of the milky way that has the black hole in it
- Navigate through space to find the chest at the center of the milky way
