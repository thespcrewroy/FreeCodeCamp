# UI / UX Design Tutorial â€“ Wireframe, Mockup & Design in Figma

## Introduction
* This tutorial gave a walkthrough of the core principles of UX Design.
* The first is the wireframe where you create a simple sketch with arrows and labels.
* The second is the UI Layout where you use Figma to create the tempelate.
* The final step is the Mockup where you personalize the tempelate to your needs.
* I did not do the wireframing or the mockup, however, I used the wireframe by Adrian Twarog to create the UI Layout in Figma.
