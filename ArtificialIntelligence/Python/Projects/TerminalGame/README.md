# Terminal Adventure Game ⛳️

## Introduction
* This is a project for Codedex
* The runner is a terminal_game.py that walks the player through a captivating mini-game adventure!
* In each step of the adventure, the player is presented with 2 or more options on where to go next.

## Video Demonstration (NF):

## *Codedex Ideas
* A space-based adventure of a crew of curious individuals exploring an unknown galaxy
* A “Day in the Life” story that walks you through choices the main character makes based on conditions like the time of day, the actions that the player take, etc.
* A classic RPG with hp health points, character moves like attack/block/heal, and NPCs (non-player characters) that attacks based on a random number generator
