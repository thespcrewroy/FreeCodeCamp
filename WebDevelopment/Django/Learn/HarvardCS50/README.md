## Introduction
***This is a course from MIT's open courseware taught by Harvard CS50 and advertised on Edx.  <br>
This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and <br>
implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. <br>
Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
By semesterâ€™s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.
This specific video teaches the Django python backend framework.***
