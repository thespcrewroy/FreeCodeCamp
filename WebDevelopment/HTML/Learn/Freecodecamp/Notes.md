## Definitions
- **Hypertext**: refers to links that connect with pages to one another, either within a single website or between website
- **Element:** consists of the starting and ending tag and everything in between
- **Opening/Closing Tag:** “<” or “>”
- **Block-Level-Elements:** where adding a new element creates a new line
- **In-Line-Level Elements:** where adding a element does not create a new line
- **Absolute reference:** full address for the web page to where we are going
- **Relative reference:** when we link to something that is already on the same server

## Standard Conventions

- **index.html**: always the file name expected to launch a website
- Always keep your file names in lowercase and with no spaces and end in “.html”
  - You are allowed to use hyphens and dashes
  - Windows will not complain but the web server we host our files too will complain
- Link Text Rules
  - Avoid printing the full web address to the page
  - Avoid “links to” phrase since we all know it is a link
  - Keep your link text as short as possible (exact topic) (no sentences)
  - No links that say “click here” as there is no context
  - Do not link your email or show your email because web spiders can harvest them, instead link to a contact form 
- Keep your images in a separate folder
- You should multiply any element using a \* and a integer
- You can only have 1 ```<h1>``` per page
- Best practice to only go down to ```<h3>```
- When adding an image check the image aspect ratio and set the width and height to the aspect ratio of the image in the code
- DO NOT use a table to structure your entire HTML page
