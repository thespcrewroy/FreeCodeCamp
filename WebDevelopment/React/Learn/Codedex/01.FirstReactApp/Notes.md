# Our Workstation
## Hot Reloading
* ***Hot Reloading:*** **A feature in React that allows developers to instantly see changes made to their code in real time**

## File Structure
* ðŸ“„ ***index.html:***: **HTML with the root of the React app (i.e., ```<div id="root"></div>```)**
* ðŸ“„ ***App.js:*** **React code that is written in JSX**
* ðŸ“„ ***index.js:*** **The place where our React app is started from**
* ðŸ“œ ***package.json:*** **A list of Node packages that help this app run, including React**
* ðŸ“„ ***styles.css:*** **Base styles for the React app.**
* **ReactJS can be installed from a node package manager like npm**

## The Root
* ***```<div id="root"></div>```***: **The index.html file features a single element with an id of "root"**
* * **This element is important because it connects our HTML and React code**
* **The root is where our React app is run**
* **This element is selected in the index.js file by a getElementById selector (const container)**
* **The selector 'container' is then passed into the createRoot() function to render the webpage (const root)**
* ***```root.render(<App />)```***: **Since App.js is the superpage that stores all the other JSX files that build the other webpages, we display our App.js by rendering it on the root with this code**
